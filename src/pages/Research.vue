### Welcome to my academic homepage !

I am Shuyun Yang, an undergraduate student majoring in physics. My research focuses on intelligent data-driven dynamical control. Currently, I am undertaking an internship in a laboratory specializing in ground-based simulation and dynamical control, where I am also completing my bachelor’s thesis.

The "[My Academia](/academic)" page of this site summarizes my academic resume, research interests, and achievements. The "[Code](/code)" page shares my open-source projects, while "[Jottings](/space1)" contains my study notes and thoughts. Additionally, you can find other interesting content on the [homepage](https://liuyinchu.github.io/). Here, I hope to share more about the process of learning and research, rather than just showcasing the results (**of course, for confidentiality reasons, some content will not be made public, and I am very cautious about this**).

Overall, I am dedicated to a vibrant and passionate research field, focusing on **applying advanced intelligent technologies to dynamical modeling and control**, and promoting the development of data-driven methods. I hope to contribute to the field of **space-based gravitational wave detection**. Meanwhile, I closely follow the cutting-edge advancements in **robotics** (especially humanoid robots) and draw inspiration from emerging technologies and solutions in this area.

## Learning

My recent studies have primarily focused on building my knowledge base in two major areas: control theory and artificial intelligence.

In control theory, I am rapidly covering the foundational and advanced topics of the field, ranging from "Signals and Systems" all the way to modern control theory.

In artificial intelligence, my current focus is on deep learning and reinforcement learning. The main textbooks I am studying are "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, et al., and "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton and Barto.

### Control Theory Studies
I am systematically organizing my study notes on this topic and will share them here later. Please stay tuned.

### Deep Learning
While studying Chapter 6, I paid special attention to the discussion on activation functions. I believe the [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_linear_unit) series and [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) are the two most important types (though [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) is also noteworthy).

### Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
- In Chapter 3, I studied dynamic programming and found an [excellent explanation](https://www.zhihu.com/question/23995189) of the topic.
- For the Racetrack problem in Chapter 4, I referenced an [existing solution](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-reinforcement-learning-racetrack-exercise-building-the-environment-33712602de0c/) that greatly helped my understanding and implementation.

## Focusing

My current research interests focus mainly on two areas:

1. **Literature on Space-based Gravitational Wave Detection**
   I am systematically studying related papers to deepen my understanding of the field.

2. **Applications of Machine Learning in Nonlinear Dynamics**
   I am exploring [how machine learning methods can be applied to nonlinear dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09707). At present, I am paying particular attention to the following directions:

   * **[Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)](https://pysindy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/summary.html):** Planning to start with the **PySINDy** library for initial experiments.
   * **Koopman Operator Methods:** Concentrating on three aspects of study—*[notes](https://fluids.ac.uk/files/meetings/KoopmanNotes.1575558616.pdf), [dynamical modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02522), and [operator theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07312)*—and continuing to learn in this area.

## Practicing

I am designing small-scale experiments to apply the control theory knowledge I have learned to practical problems, in order to strengthen my understanding and gain hands-on experience.

## 欢迎访问我的学术主页。

我是杨舒云，物理学本科生。我的研究方向聚焦于智能化的数据驱动动力学控制。目前，我在一个从事地面模拟与动力学控制的研究室实习，并在此完成本科毕业设计。

本站“[我的学术](/academic)”页面汇总了我的学术履历、研究兴趣及成果。“[代码](/code)”页面分享了我的开源项目，而“[随记](/space1)”则记录了我的学习笔记与思考。此外，在本站[主页](https://liuyinchu.github.io/)你也能找到一些其它的有趣的内容。在这里，我更希望分享的是学习与科研的过程，而非仅仅展示结果（当然，出于保密原因，部分内容不会公开，我对此十分谨慎）。

总体而言，我投身于一个充满热情与活力的研究方向，专注于将先进的智能技术应用于动力学建模与控制，推动数据驱动方法的发展，希望能为空间引力波探测贡献自己的力量。同时，我密切关注机器人学（特别是人形机器人）的前沿进展，并从中汲取新兴技术与解决方案的灵感。
