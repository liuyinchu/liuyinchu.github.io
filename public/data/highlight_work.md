# Applying Advanced Intelligent Technologies to Drag-Free Control for Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detection

My research is centered on the major scientific mission of space-based gravitational wave detection, specifically within the context of the **TianQin** project. The focus is to address the extreme performance challenges faced by one of its key subsystems — **Drag-Free Control (DFC)** technology.

The core idea of my work is to **deeply integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques—particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods—with high-precision control**. This integration is not intended to directly replace traditional control theory. Instead, the goal is to harness the powerful nonlinear mapping and optimization capabilities of AI to help overcome the bottlenecks of conventional control approaches in areas such as complex disturbance suppression, multi-objective coordinated optimization, and system adaptivity. In doing so, we aim to extend the performance boundaries and enhance the intelligence of the control system.
