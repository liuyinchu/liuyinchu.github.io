# Applying Data-Driven Intelligent Technologies to Drag-Free Control for Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detection — From Nonlinear Dynamics Data-Driven Modeling to “**Agile yet Extremely Safe (AyES) Reinforcement Learning**” for Intelligent Active Vibration Isolation and Drag-Free Techniques

My research is centered on the major scientific mission of space-based gravitational wave detection, specifically within the context of the **TianQin** project. The focus is to address the extreme performance challenges faced by one of its key subsystems — **Drag-Free Control (DFC)** technology.

The core idea of my work is to **deeply integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques—particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods—with high-precision control**. This integration is not intended to directly replace traditional control theory. Instead, the goal is to harness the powerful nonlinear mapping and optimization capabilities of AI to help overcome the bottlenecks of conventional control approaches in areas such as complex disturbance suppression, multi-objective coordinated optimization, and system adaptivity. In doing so, we aim to extend the performance boundaries and enhance the intelligence of the control system.

      <h4>Stage I: Foundation & Learning</h4>
      <p><strong>Keyword:</strong> Data-Driven Modeling (DDM)<br>We focus on the topic “Applications of Machine Learning and Data-Driven Nonlinear Dynamics Modeling in Ground-Based Active Vibration Isolation Systems” and begin on the ground, using Machine Learning to enhance existing AVI systems. At this stage, I will study a range of machine learning methods and apply them to the nonlinear dynamics modeling of ground-based active vibration isolation systems. On the one hand, this process allows me to accumulate AI knowledge and technical expertise; on the other, it validates the core concept of AI-augmented control in a tangible way, providing a low-risk foundation for subsequent space-based applications.</p>
